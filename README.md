ExploreEase is a website that helps people find cool places to visit, like attractions and
restaurants. On the homepage, there’s a search box where users can type in a city, and it updates
in real-time with results. If they don’t search, they’ll see nine random cities displayed as
clickable cards. When they click on a city, they’ll go to a new page where they can pick between
Attractions or Restaurants. After they choose, the site will show a list of places in that city with
descriptions, ratings, and images. The goal is to make the experience simple, fast, and fun
